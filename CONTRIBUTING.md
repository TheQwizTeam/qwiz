# How to Contribute

## Overview
Qwiz uses the pull-request GIT model. All bug fixes / new features should be created on separate branches and a pull-request made to merge the code back into the master branch.

## Getting Started
- Make sure you have a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup/free)
- Open an Issue for the issue, if one does not already exist
- Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes
- Create a topic branch to house your work, usually branched off `master` using `git checkout -b my_fix master`
- Split the work into logical commits with properly formatted commit messages:
  * Separate subject from body with a blank line
  * Limit the subject line to 50 characters
  * Capitalize the subject line
  * Do not end the subject line with a period
  * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
  * Wrap the body at 72 characters
  * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
